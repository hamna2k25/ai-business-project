# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis Report

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs a **comprehensive customer churn analysis** using a small sample dataset of 7 customers. It visualizes customer retention patterns, churn rates by gender and age group, and predicts churn trends over tenure. The interactive React dashboard allows toggling between **customer details** and **visual analysis**.

> **Note:** This project was created using **Clute**, an AI code generation tool. I designed the business problem, selected the dataset, and used Clute to generate the model code. I then interpreted the results and created visualizations using Recharts and React.
