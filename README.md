# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis Report  
An interactive dashboard built with **React** and **Recharts** to analyze customer churn patterns through data visualization.

This project demonstrates basic data analytics concepts such as churn rate, customer behavior segmentation, and predictive insights based on tenure, age, and contract type.
